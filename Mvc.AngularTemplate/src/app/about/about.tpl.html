    The Elevator Pitch
    <small>For the lazy and impatient.</small>
  </h1>
  <p>
    <code>mvc-ng-boilerplate</code> is an opinionated kickstarter for web
    development projects based on <code>ng-boilerplate</code>. It's an attempt to create a simple starter for new
    web sites and apps: just download it and start coding. The goal is to
    have everything you need to get started out of the box; of course it has
    slick styles and icons, but it also has a best practice directory structure
    to ensure maximum code reuse.  Additionally, it is ready for VS 2012 MVC4 so 
    you don't have to struggle with wiring the two architectures together. And it's all tied together with a robust
    build system chock-full of some time-saving goodness.
  </p>

  <h2>Why?</h2>

  <p>
    Because every website <em>should</em> start the same, and 
     AngularJS has become my client-side framework of choice. We start
    websites the same way every time: create a directory structure, copy and
    ever-so-slightly tweak some config files from an older project, and yada
    yada, etc., and so on and so forth. Why are we repeating ourselves? We wanted a starting point; a set of
    best practices that we could identify our projects as embodying and a set of
    time-saving wonderfulness, because time is money.
  </p>

  <p>
    There are other similar projects out there, but none of them suited our
    needs. Some are awesome but were just too much, existing more as reference
    implementations, when we really just wanted a kickstarter. Others were just
    too little, with puny build systems and unscalable architectures.  None integrated with 
    Visual Studio which is the tool I have to use and wanted the WebAPI backend. So I
    designed <code>mvc-ng-boilerplate</code> to be just right.
  </p>

  <h2>What ng-boilerplate Is Not</h2>

  <p>
    This is not an example of an AngularJS app. This is a kickstarter.  It has a demo section
    in the about page to show you how to interact with the REST WebAPI, but that's it. If
    you're looking for an example of what a complete, non-trivial AngularJS app
    that does something real looks like, complete with a REST backend and
    authentication and authorization, then take a look at <code><a
        href="https://github.com/angular-app/angular-app/">angular-app</a></code>, 
    which does just that, and does it well.
  </p>

  <h1 class="page-header">
    So What's Included?
    <small>I'll try to be more specific than "awesomeness".</small>
  </h1>
  <p>
    This section is just a quick introduction to all the junk that comes
    pre-packaged with <code>mvc-ng-boilerplate</code>. For information on how to
    use it, see the <a
      href="https://github.com/gongin/mvc-ng-boilerplate#readme">project page</a> at
    GitHub.
  </p>

  <p>
    The high-altitude view is that the base project includes 
    <a href="http://getbootstrap.com">Twitter Bootstrap</a>
    styles to quickly produce slick-looking responsive web sites and apps. It also
    includes <a href="http://angular-ui.github.com/bootstrap">UI Bootstrap</a>,
    a collection of native AngularJS directives based on the aforementioned
    templates and styles. It also includes <a href="http://fortawesome.github.com/Font-Awesome/">Font Awesome</a>,
    a wicked-cool collection of font-based icons that work swimmingly with all
    manner of web projects; in fact, all images on the site are actually font-
    based icons from Font Awesome. Neat! Lastly, this also includes
    <a href="http://joshdmiller.github.com/angular-placeholders">Angular Placeholders</a>,
    a set of pure AngularJS directives to do client-side placeholder images and
    text to make mocking user interfaces super easy.
  </p>

  <p>
    And, of course, <code>mvc-ng-boilerplate</code> is built on <a href="http://angularjs.org">AngularJS</a>,
    by the far the best JavaScript framework out there! But if you don't know
    that already, then how did you get here? Well, no matter - just drink the
    Kool Aid. Do it. You know you want to.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Twitter Bootstrap</h2>

  <p>
    You already know about this, right? If not, <a
      href="http://getbootstrap.com">hop on over</a> and check it out; it's
    pretty sweet. Anyway, all that wonderful stylistic goodness comes built in.
    The LESS files are available for you to import in your main stylesheet as
    needed - no excess, no waste. There is also a dedicated place to override
    variables and mixins to suit your specific needs, so updating to the latest
    version of Bootstrap is as simple as: 
  </p>

  <pre>&gt; cd vendor/twitter-bootstrap<br />&gt; git pull origin master</pre>

  <p>
    Boom! And victory is ours.
  </p>

  <h2>UI Bootstrap</h2>

  <p>
    What's better than Bootstrap styles? Bootstrap directives!  The fantastic <a href="http://angular-ui.github.com/bootstrap">UI Bootstrap</a>
    library contains a set of native AngularJS directives that are endlessly
    extensible. You get the tabs, the tooltips, the accordions. You get your
    carousel, your modals, your pagination. And <i>more</i>.
    How about a quick demo? 
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li class="dropdown">
      <a class="btn dropdown-toggle">
        Click me!
      </a>
      <ul class="dropdown-menu">
        <li ng-repeat="choice in dropdownDemoItems">
          <a>{{choice}}</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Oh, and don't include jQuery;  
    you don't need it.
    This is better.
    Don't be one of those people. <sup>*</sup>
  </p>

  <p><small><sup>*</sup> Yes, there are exceptions.</small></p>

  <h2>Font Awesome</h2>

  <p>
    Font Awesome has earned its label. It's a set of open (!) icons that come
    distributed as a font (!) for super-easy, lightweight use. Font Awesome 
    works really well with Twitter Bootstrap, and so fits right in here.
  </p>

  <p>
    There is not a single image on this site. All of the little images and icons 
    are drawn through Font Awesome! All it takes is a little class:
  </p>

  <pre>&lt;i class="icon-flag"&gt;&lt/i&gt</pre>

  <p>
    And you get one of these: <i class="icon-flag"> </i>. Neat!
  </p>

  <h2>Placeholders</h2>

  <p>
    Angular Placeholders is a simple library for mocking up text and images. You
    can automatically throw around some "lorem ipsum" text:
  </p>

  <pre>&lt;p ph-txt="3s"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</pre>

  <p>
    Which gives you this:
  </p>

  <div class="pre">
    &lt;p&gt;
    <p ph-txt="3s"></p>
    &lt;/p&gt;
  </div>

  <p>
    Even more exciting, you can also create placeholder images, entirely 
    client-side! For example, this:
  </p>
  
  <pre>
&lt;img ph-img="50x50" /&gt;
&lt;img ph-img="50x50" class="img-polaroid" /&gt;
&lt;img ph-img="50x50" class="img-rounded" /&gt;
&lt;img ph-img="50x50" class="img-circle" /&gt;</pre>

  <p>
    Gives you this:
  </p>

  <div>
    <img ph-img="50x50" />
    <img ph-img="50x50" class="img-polaroid" />
    <img ph-img="50x50" class="img-rounded" />
    <img ph-img="50x50" class="img-circle" />
  </div>

  <p>
    Which is awesome.
  </p>

    The Roadmap
    <small>Really? What more could you want?</small>
  </h1>

  <p>
    This is a project that is <i>not</i> broad in scope, so there's not really
    much of a wish list here.
